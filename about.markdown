Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a Computer Networks graduate from Sheffield Hallam University. I'm a support engineer by day & self proclaimed mechanical keyboard/indoor plant aficionado by night. ðŸ¦‡

These pages serve their purpose by giving me a space to document any hobbies which I dabble in to, which in all honesty is primarily my keyboard builds. I'll showcase the components used, how I build it & how so much care and attention can go in to the daily drivers we typically use for upwards of 8 hours a day.

If you want to have a chat or ask about anything including any of the topics on my posts, suggestions, or even maybe a custom keyboard for yourself... please reach me on any of my platforms below or on the contact form.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a Computer Networks graduate from Sheffield Hallam University. During the day I work as a support engineer, but during the night (and the weekends when they come around) I turn into a self proclaimed mechanical keyboard and indoor plant aficionado.

These pages serve their purpose by giving me a space to document any of my keyboard builds, showing a bit into the components used, how I build it, and how so much care and attention can go in to the daily drivers we typically use for upwards of 8 hours a day.

**Still not sold on a custom keyboard?**

Assuming I started working at the ripe old age of 20, which I did, and worked every week day until the age of 60, probably a **bold** assumption, i'd be working for 2,086 weeks of my life, approximately. Out of that total, i'd spend about 10,429 days at work, excluding weekends.

Assuming again this is working a 8 hour shift every day, i'd spend a total time of 83,432 hours working using a keyboard. That's 3,476 days of my life, approximately of course, at a keyboard, excluding any over time, weekends, you name it. You'd think a decent keyboard is a worthy investment, no?

If you're going to buy a nice car which you will spend approximately 4 years of your life driving in total, you might aswell buy a nice keyboard which you'll be using for 9 and a half years right? ðŸ˜‰

If you want to ask about anything, including any of the topics on my posts, suggestions, or even maybe a custom keyboard for yourself... please reach me on any of my platforms below or on the contact form.
